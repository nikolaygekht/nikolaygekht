I earn first money developing the program in 1988 (I was in high school) developing receipe management software for a milk factory. 
It ran a Soviet copy of PDP-11 microcomputer called DVK and was written in pure K&R C. Then there were years of assembler programming for 8080, Z80, 8086, 80386. 
Then came Windows 3.0 and C++. 20 years, dozen of languages and handful of OSes, I currently mostly use C# and occasionally develop cross-platform Windows/Linux apps. 

Last few years, while still acting as a architect and project leader, I shifted my focus 
to organization of the development team, business agility and... education. 

As an educator I deliver Microsoft's C# developer and Azure developer as well as ICAgile's ICP course. For sure, I am open for 
coaching and mentoring about development or Agile questions. Please feel free to take a look at my [courses flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156kvv4rXTR0PYOwpkj_zMCj_gU7D3uep/view?usp=sharing)

So... welcome to my page and don't forget to take a look at my company's page, most of open source projects, that I support, 
are located there [@gehtsoft-usa](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa?q=&type=public).
